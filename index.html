    <p2>A war is when two or more nations or states or different groups within a nation or state is in a state of armed conflict. Warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. This is a parasite to human culture as it has many negative impacts on the human experince and the planet we live in. Not only do the soilders face massive physical and pshycological damage. The death of said soilders affects their comrads and the families back home hopefully awaiting their return. 
        Soldiers experience war differently than civilians, although either suffer in times of war, and women and children suffer unspeakable atrocities in particular. In the past decade, up to two million of those killed in armed conflicts were children. The widespread trauma caused by these atrocities and suffering of the civilian population is another legacy of these conflicts, the following creates extensive emotional and psychological stress.</p2> <hr>
