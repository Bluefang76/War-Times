<h2>The total amount of war deaths have declined since 1945</h2>
<p1>The number of war deaths has been declining since 1946. During the years of the early post-war era, approximately 500,000 people died through direct volence in wars. In 2016 the number of all battle-related deaths in conflicts involving at least one state was 87,432. </p1><br><br>
   <p1> The decline of the absolute number of battle deaths can be seen in the visualization here that shows global battle deaths per year by world region. There are three marked peaks in war deaths since then: the Korean War (early 1950s), the Vietnam War (around 1970), and the Iran-Iraq and Afghanistan wars (1980s). There has been a recent increase in battle deaths driven by conflict in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
